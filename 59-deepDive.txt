//61- fragments
in react, we can return multiple value. We can return only value(this one value may contain multiple value ).
return(
<div><p/><p/></div>
);
This is valid but not below one.
return(<p/><p/>);

basically, we need one wrapping value before returning somthing.For this react provide us "Fragment" component.But now, react accept empty tag also <>,</>.

//coding exercise

//63 -When we should split component

//64- spliting the components based on features and state
//65- problem: Props are not forwarded to inner elements
->Forwarded Props
->Multiple Components Slots
->Element Identifiers as Props
->Default Prop Values


//66- forwarded props to wrap elements

...props --->

//68- dynamic setting

//69-setting default prop values

//70-tic tac toe projects

//71- Not all contents go to components
Basic startup

//72- public folder vs src/asset folder in react
images stored in the public folder can be accessed directly from browser. e.g., localhost:5173/some-image.jpg
but src/asset images are only accessable by the project or in the project. e.g., localhost:5173/src/assets/some-image.jpg--> this will give us error

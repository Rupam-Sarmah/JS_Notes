//61- fragments
in react, we can return multiple value. We can return only value(this one value may contain multiple value ).
return(
<div><p/><p/></div>
);
This is valid but not below one.
return(<p/><p/>);

basically, we need one wrapping value before returning somthing.For this react provide us "Fragment" component.But now, react accept empty tag also <>,</>.

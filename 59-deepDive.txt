//61- fragments
in react, we can return multiple value. We can return only value(this one value may contain multiple value ).
return(
<div><p/><p/></div>
);
This is valid but not below one.
return(<p/><p/>);

basically, we need one wrapping value before returning somthing.For this react provide us "Fragment" component.But now, react accept empty tag also <>,</>.

//coding exercise

//63 -When we should split component

//64- spliting the components based on features and state
//65- problem: Props are not forwarded to inner elements
